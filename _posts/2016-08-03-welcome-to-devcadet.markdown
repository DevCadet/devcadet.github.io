DevCadet is your new online computer science classroom. It provides useful tools that augment an introductory Java computer science curriculum, such as the one provided by Microsoft Citizenship's [Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS)][teals] program. DevCadet's key features include:

  * A **Java autograder**, which automatically scores student responses to practice problems.

  * A collection of **practice problems** that help students refine their knowledge of Java basics.

  * An **online code editor**, which makes it easy for students to try out ideas and visualize the execution of programs. The editor is inspired by the [Java Visualizer][java-visualizer].

DevCadet is rolling out in pieces over the next few months. Watch this site to see what we come up with.
